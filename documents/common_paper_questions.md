* ### Contributions and applications of AbdomenAtlas-8K
Two contributions: A large-scale dataset of 8,448 annotated CT volumes and an active learning procedure that can quickly create many other large-scale datasets. Firstly, AbdomenAtlas-8K was a composite dataset that unified medical datasets from at least 26 different hospitals worldwide. In total, more than 60.6$\times$10*{9}
 voxels were annotated in AbdomenAtlas-8K in comparison with 
 voxels annotated in the existing public datasets. We scaled up the organ annotation by a factor of 15. Once released, AbdomenAtlas-8K can be used to benchmark existing segmentation models and foster medical foundation models for a range of downstream applications. Secondly, the proposed active learning procedure can generate an attention map to highlight the regions to be revised by radiologists, reducing the annotation time from 30.8 years to three weeks. This strategy can scale up annotations quickly for creating medical datasets or even natural imaging datasets.
